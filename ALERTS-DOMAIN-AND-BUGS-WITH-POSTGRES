Please take the following points into consideration:

1.- We are using Identities V3. That means, the WEB Dashboard (Horizon)
    will ask you the "domain" along username and password. The default
    domain is "Default" (with capital "D"). If you are using MySQL/Mariadb
    as database backend, you will be able to use "default" or "Default",
    but, with postgres, you "NEED" to put "Default" with the capital "D".

2.- If you use postgres as your database backend, you will encounter some
    nasty bugs with cinder and trove (only affecting the operations trough
    the dashboard, not the cli), causing some failures in nova and
    trove-backup functions. The bug is already reported to openstack
    maintainers and we just need to wait until it's fixed. Meanwhile, if
    you can, please try to use MySQL/MariaDB as database backend, or, read
    bellow for a temporary patch:

NOTE: The bug is reported in the following links:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1452888
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/245662/

Meanwhile "upstream" solve it, you can apply a "temporal" patch by using the
following command where your "horizon" dashboard is installed:


Liberty in Ubuntu 14.04:

sed -r -i "s/bootable=1/bootable=\'true\'/g" \
/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/dashboards/project/instances/workflows/create_instance.py
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart


Liberty in Centos 7:

sed -r -i "s/bootable=1/bootable=\'true\'/g" \
/usr/share/openstack-dashboard/openstack_dashboard/dashboards/project/instances/workflows/create_instance.py
systemctl restart httpd

Again, this only affects operations trough Horizon when Postgres is selected as
a database backend. Operations trough the openstack "cli" should be safe.
