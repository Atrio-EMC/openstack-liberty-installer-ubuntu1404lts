Please take the following points into consideration:

1.- We are using Identities V3. That means, the WEB Dashboard (Horizon)
    will ask you the "domain" along username and password. The default
    domain is "Default" (with capital "D"). If you are using MySQL/Mariadb
    as database backend, you will be able to use "default" or "Default",
    but, with postgres, you "NEED" to put "Default" with the capital "D".

2.- If you use postgres as your database backend, you will encounter some
    nasty bugs with cinder and trove, specially afecting some nova and
    trove-backup functions. The bug is already reported to openstack
    maintainers and we just need to wait until it's fixed. Meanwhile, if
    you can, please try to use MySQL/MariaDB as database backend.
